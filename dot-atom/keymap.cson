# User keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to stylesheets. Just as stylesheets use selectors
# to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts. Here's a small example, excerpted
# from Atom's built-in keymaps:
#
#'.editor':
#  'enter': 'editor:newline'
#
#".select-list .editor.mini":
#  'enter': 'core:confirm'
