## Focus for week ahead

- Atom IDE
- @atom/watcher
  - Diagnose crashes and lockups on Atom launch (@smashwilson)
- GitHub Package
  - Finish "Remember me" within the credential dialog (@smashwilson) [#1327](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1327)
  - Write up `docs/vision` from meeting notes (@smashwilson)

- Teletype
- Tree-sitter
  - Carrying over goals from previous weeks:
    - Optimize syntax tree updates in the presence of syntax errors. This will improve performance across the board but also make Tree-sitter usable in edge cases where the wrong language is being used to parse a document.
