## Highlights from the past week

- Atom IDE
- @atom/watcher
- GitHub Package
- Teletype
- Xray
  - We made a slight change of plans and decided to spend more time clarifying the overall vision for the project.
  - We have a [branch](https://github.com/atom/xray/tree/roadmap) with a new README that matches our current thinking, but the Q1 roadmap is still in progress.
  - We did manage to get text rendering with retina displays and non-clipped characters, but there's still work to do. We are also experimenting populating our glyph atlas with up to 4 variants of each glyph at different subpixel positions to more closely match text rendered purely on the CPU.

## Focus for week ahead

- Atom IDE
- @atom/watcher
- GitHub Package
- Teletype
- Tree-sitter
- Xray
  - We will continue clarifying the overall vision with a focus on real time collaboration. This may extend beyond the scope of Xray, but is important to get clarity on before comitting to a roadmap.
  - We hope to iron out the remaining issues with subpixel-positioning of glyphs to more faithfully reproduce Chrome's behavior when rendering text via the normal DOM-based code path.
