## Highlights from the past week

- Atom IDE
- GitHub Package
  - Automated the production of `gpg` and `gpg-agent` binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux with [squeegpg-native](https://github.com/atom/squeegpg-native).
  - Investigated the setup for [including a TypeScript transpiler in an Atom package](https://github.com/smashwilson/minimal-typescript-atom) with React.
  - Begin an npm package, [squeegpg](https://github.com/atom/squeegpg), to wrap GPG interaction and gpg-agent management using the binaries from [squeegpg-native](https://github.com/atom/squeegpg-native). Set up a bunch of yak-shaving tasks like configuring Circle/AppVeyor/Travis CI and installing Greenkeeper.
  - Upgrade `fs-extra` and replace our proliferating helper methods with the already-Promisified versions from the newer version. [atom/github#1350](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1350)
- Teletype
- Tree-sitter
- Xray

## Focus for week ahead

- Atom IDE
- GitHub Package
  - Finish defining the public interface for [squeegpg](https://github.com/atom/squeegpg) and consume it from atom/github.
