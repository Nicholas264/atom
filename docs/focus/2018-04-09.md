## Highlights from the past week

- Atom IDE
- GitHub Package
  - Began transcribing our vision meeting notes in [atom/github#1372](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1372). @smashwilson
  - More progress on [atom/github#1376 "Create pull request"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1376). The happy paths work well for publishing and pushing a branch, but it isn't ready to merge until I adjust our messaging in a few edge cases. @smashwilson
  - Started implementing [atom/github/#1374 "Add dialog for new co-author"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1374).  This includes UI polish and some bugfixes for existing co author flows.  @kuychaco / @annthurium
  - Merged [atom/github#1364 "Undo last commit and amend context menu option"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1364) @kuychaco / @annthurium
