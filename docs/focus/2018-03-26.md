  - Review and merge @t9md's PRs to preserve selections when a buffer is open in multiple editors and undo and redo are triggered. [atom/text-buffer#287](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/287), [#16564](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16564)
  - Prevent bracket-matcher from triggering onDidChange before the final cursor placement, which caused the wrong cursor position to be send to autocomplete providers. [atom/autocomplete-plus#954](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/issues/954)
